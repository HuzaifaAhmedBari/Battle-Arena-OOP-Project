## Overview
**Battle Arena** is a turn-based role-playing game (RPG) built with C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The game is designed to be a strategic battle experience where players can control characters with unique abilities, fighting against enemies in a dynamic arena. It incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation.

## Features
- **Turn-based Combat**: Players take turns to attack, defend, and use abilities in a strategic combat environment.

- **Sound and Music**: Background music and sound effects are included to enhance gameplay.
- **Enemy AI**: The enemies use simple AI to make strategic decisions during combat.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language used for game logic.
- **SFML**: Library used for handling graphics, window management, and events.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The game is designed with OOP principles such as:
  - **Polymorphism**: For handling different character abilities.
  - **Inheritance**: For creating character classes and special enemy types.
  - **Encapsulation**: For maintaining clean code with private/protected variables and functions.
